## Overview

AtomOS is a platform that sits between AI agents and open-source libraries/tools. It provides:

- **AI-native blocks**: Standardized building units with inputs, outputs, side-effects, and examples.
- **Pre-defined workflows**: Deterministic sequences of blocks compiled at development time.
- **Execution runtime**: Agents simply execute workflows without improvising.

Think of it as **n8n, but for AI agents**, turning existing OSS libraries into composable, reusable, and deterministic workflows.

## Goals

- Reduce AI agent hallucinations and runtime reasoning.
- Enable reusable, testable, and standardized workflows.
- Create a registry of blocks and workflows that any AI system can import and execute.
